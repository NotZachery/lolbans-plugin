Basis of plugin design: https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/litebans.3715/



The "Lite" version of lolbans should have everything litebans has, plus a little more
the full version of lolbans should have everything under the sun (it's $20, it better have lots of features) this includes stupid thingys like
analytics and other dumb shit, basically the full version is a core plugin with everything related to analytics and punishments.
while the lite version is just strictly punishments.

Business model
#########################################
Website is now our profit capability, make the site similar to how LuckPerms manages permissions except for bans, force license keys to use the site
for validation, the java plugin is now considered to be a loss (see also: purecore.io).

With the website, we offer real-time analytics, punishments from web, appealing system, etc. This will be offered as a service 
(the plugin itself will cost whatever amount). The service will be offered at a fixed rate 
(x amount of free punishments then 0.005 cents per punishments or something stupid). I would like this to be a cheap service for people to use 
while still making money. (Maybe make the service free and have premium features? For example, you can get punishment stats and punishments from web,
but you don't get the appeal/reporting system. This needs to be appealing, so it ends up actually making profit, maybe make the plugin beta paid and full release cheaper/free?
People donate like crazy anyway..)

Minimum Viable Product (MVP) / Feature Freeze:
##########################################
 - /staffhistory - Staff history and mass unbans to undo - Zachery/Justin
 - Hover Text (JSON) - Zachery/Justin?
 - /dupeip, /iphistory - Justin/Zachery
 - /prunehistory <Player|PunishID|CIDR> <Distance In Time|*> - Zachery?
 - All commands need rewrite to be async (player runs command, onCommand() return immediately but runs command in thread unless bukkit is an ass about API calls) - Justin/maybe Zachery
 - /history needs to be converted to use messages.yml instead of hard-coded strings - Zachery
 - Permissions (make sure they're granular enough?) - Zachery
 - REST api for website.
 - Report types (Cheating, Chat, ETC)
 - Eliminate "Global" ban announcements, instead make them individual permissions. This is more flexible.
 - Eliminate a large "alerts" announcement class and make an alerts permission for each event. (eg, ipbans would get "lolbans.IPBan.announce" instead of "lolbans.alerts")
 - List bans, regex bans, ip bans, warnings, etc. and ensure they're easy to remove.
 - Fuck off with spigot's default syntax handlers and do our own with messages.yml.
 - Standardize the name for who the hell bans someone. Are they `Banner`, `Executioner`, `Moderator`, `StaffMember`, `Issuer`, etc.?
 - TESTING TESTING TESTING TESTING TESTING!!! - everyone!

# Future (or nice to have after the MVP)
##########################################
5. Mass unbans (??)
6. Ensure targets can be names, uuids, ip addresses, or ip address ranges (CIDRs).
7. Lockdown support (incl., per-server lockdowns)
8. Timezones???
9. Support IP bans by hostname
10. Link reports to bans if a report is marked for punishment by staff

##########################################
# Cross-Server stuffs
##########################################
1. Bans
2. Kicks
3. Broadcasts
4. Server scopes (to allow for per-server punishments)

##########################################
# WAYYYYY FUTURE:
##########################################
1. Cross-API compatibility (lol)
2. Cross-database compatibility
3. Allow shell-command executed ip bans to use for iptables and similar command line firewalls.
4. Inventory GUI (or just make an API for lolbans and have someone else do it, because it'll happen)
5. GeoIP support
6. Regex Name Bans.
7. Import punishments from other plugins
8. Local file storage instead of databases
