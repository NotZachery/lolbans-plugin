Basis of plugin design: https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/litebans.3715/

In Progress
3. Staff history and mass unbans to undo (optionally within time range)
1. IP bans using CIDRs
19. /staffhistory

# TODO
0. Add message prefix to all messages (so they all say [lolbans] or whatever optionally// maybe make this a default arg inside arrays in MessageUtil?)
1. Hover text (JSON)
2. REST api for website.
3. Mass unbans (??)
4. Ensure targets can be names, uuids, ip addresses, or ip address ranges (CIDRs).

5. /dupeip, /iphistory, /ipreport
6. Lockdown support (incl., per-server lockdowns)
7. Timezones???
8. ALL THE PERMISSION NODESSSSSSSSS~~~~
9. /prunehistory 
10. Player-side /report functionality
11. ???? Ensure multithreaded/asynchronous database queries for most/all things (we don't ever want to hang the main thread).
12. Support IP bans by hostname

# Cross-Server stuffs
1. Bans
2. Kicks
3. Broadcasts
4. Server scopes (to allow for per-server punishments)

# WAYYYYY FUTURE:
1. Cross-API compatibility (lol)
2. Cross-database compatibility
3. Allow shell-command executed ip bans to use for iptables and similar command line firewalls.
4. Inventory GUI (or just make an API for lolbans and have someone else do it, because it'll happen)
5. GeoIP support
6. Regex Name Bans.
