Basis of plugin design: https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/litebans.3715/

1. IP bans using CIDRs
2. Hover text (JSON)
3. Staff history and mass unbans to undo (optionally within time range)
4. Mass unbans
5. Unreasonable ban warnings before executing a ban which can affect a large number of players.
6. Website functionality (banning, unbanning, comments, disputes, etc.)
7. Ensure targets can be names, uuids, ip addresses, or ip address ranges (CIDRs).
8. Server scopes (to allow for per-server punishments)
9. Freeze command (since warn already does this.)
10. /dupeip, /iphistory, /ipreport
11. /kick history tracking -- support cross-server kicking
12. GeoIP support
13. Lockdown support (incl., per-server lockdowns)
14. Timezones???
15. /broadcast (including cross-server)
16. ALL THE PERMISSION NODESSSSSSSSS~~~~
17. /prunehistory 
18. Player-side /report functionality
19. /staffhistory
20. Make User.FindPlayerByBanID async with FutureTask
21. Ensure multithreaded/asynchronous database queries for most/all things (we don't ever want to hang the main thread).
22. Check to make sure an IP ban is not part of an already-banned CIDR range.
23. Support IP bans by hostname
24. Regex Name Bans.
25. REST api for website.

# WAYYYYY FUTURE:
1. Cross-server compatibility (lol)
2. Cross-database compatibility
3. Allow shell-command executed ip bans to use for iptables and similar command line firewalls.
4. Inventory GUI (or just make an API for lolbans and have someone else do it, because it'll happen)
