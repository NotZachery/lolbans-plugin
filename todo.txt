Basis of plugin design: https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/litebans.3715/



The "Lite" version of lolbans should have everything litebans has, plus a little more
the full version of lolbans should have everything under the sun (it's $20, it better have lots of features) this includes stupid thingys like
analytics and other dumb shit, basically the full version is a core plugin with everything related to analytics and punishments.
while the lite version is just strictly punishments.

Business model
#########################################
Website is now our profit capability, make the site similar to how LuckPerms manages permissions except for bans, force license keys to use the site
for validation, the java plugin is now considered to be a loss (see also: purecore.io).

With the website, we offer real-time analytics, punishments from web, appealing system, etc. This will be offered as a service 
(the plugin itself will cost whatever amount). The service will be offered at a fixed rate 
(x amount of free punishments then 0.005 cents per punishments or something stupid). I would like this to be a cheap service for people to use 
while still making money. (Maybe make the service free and have premium features? For example, you can get punishment stats and punishments from web,
but you don't get the appeal/reporting system. This needs to be appealing, so it ends up actually making profit, maybe make the plugin beta paid and full release cheaper/free?
People donate like crazy anyway..)

lol may/june release pls - hah! if we're lucky!
