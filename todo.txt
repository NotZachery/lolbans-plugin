Basis of plugin design: https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/litebans-%C2%BB-50-off-%C2%AB-black-friday-sale.3715/

1. IP bans using CIDRs
2. Hover text (JSON)
3. Staff history and mass unbans to undo (optionally within time range)
4. Mass unbans
5. Unreasonable ban warnings before executing a ban which can affect a large number of players.
6. Website functionality (banning, unbanning, comments, disputes, etc.)
7. Fix silent ban argument (easy)
8. Ensure targets can be names, uuids, ip addresses, or ip address ranges (CIDRs).
9. Server scopes (to allow for per-server punishments)
10. Freeze command (since warn already does this.)
11. /dupeip, /iphistory, /ipreport
12. /kick history tracking -- support cross-server kicking
13. GeoIP support
14. Lockdown support (incl., per-server lockdowns)
15. Timezones???
16. /broadcast (including cross-server)
17. ALL THE PERMISSION NODESSSSSSSSS~~~~
18. /mute, /mutechat
19. /prunehistory 
20. Player-side /report functionality
21. /staffhistory
22. Make User.FindPlayerByBanID async with FutureTask
23. Ensure multithreaded/asynchronous database queries for most/all things (we don't ever want to hang the main thread).


# WAYYYYY FUTURE:
1. Cross-server compatibility (lol)
2. Cross-database compatibility
