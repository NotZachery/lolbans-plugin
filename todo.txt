Basis of plugin design: https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/litebans.3715/

#########################################
Plugin model
#########################################

The plugin will eventually be free and possibly open source, but the alpha/beta will cost you $15-$20 but you get Premium for free (forever) on release.
You will be able to do everything other plugins do and a more, all for free on release.

It should at the very least have more capabilities than all plugins on the market.

##########################################
Minimum Viable Product (MVP) / Feature Freeze:
##########################################
 - [Feature] /alt, /iphistory, /regexhistory - Justin/Zachery
 - [Feature] Rewrite messages.yml to use new variables.
 - [Feature] List bans, regex bans, ip bans, warnings, etc. and ensure they're easy to remove.

##########################################
# Future (or nice to have after the MVP)
##########################################

##########################################
# Cross-Server stuffs
##########################################
1. Bans
2. Kicks
