# Messages.yml - All plugin text is in this file
# 
# Anything between curley brackets is replaced with the values of the named variables.
# Names of variables or filters are case insensitive.
# Some variables are passed through filters before they become part of the string.
# The filter syntax is as follows:
#   {VARIABLE|filter:"argument"}
# Take the following example:
#  "There is {PLAYERCOUNT} player{PLAYERCOUNT|pluralize} online"
# assuming PLAYERCOUNT is 5, it will be rendered as:
#  "There is 5 players online"
# 
# Most of these tags will follow Python's Django web framework's filter syntax.
# You can read about these here: https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.0/ref/templates/builtins/#built-in-filter-reference
#
# The following filters have been implemented:
# - pluralize - Adds the plural suffix if the value is not 1. Syntax is identical to Django's pluralize.
# - datetime - Parse date and/or time to a human-readable string. Uses Java's SimpleDateFormat seen here: 
#              https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/text/SimpleDateFormat.html
# - duration - relative time before or after a date (eg, "2 years, 4 weeks, 3 days, 22 hours, 16 minutes, 2 seconds")
# - expiry - similar to duration but adds "ago", "from now", or "never expires" (if expiry is none or 0)
# - cut - remove a character from the string. Identical to Django's cut filter.
# - empty_if_false - if variable is true, it will return the string given as an argument (used )
# - default_if_none - uses the argument as the string if the variable is null (identical django syntax)
# - lower - variable is converted to lower case
# - upper - variable is converted to upper case
# - yesno - converts a boolean to "yes" or "no" or custom yes/no boolean (identical syntax to Django minus the "maybe")

# Global variables, you can use these in any message in this file.
